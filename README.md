## Overview
This project offers a Python-based Telegram bot, encapsulated within a Docker container, designed to simplify the utilization of the Telegram Bot API. It aims to make the creation and deployment of Telegram bots more accessible, enabling users to offer services through these bots efficiently.

You can find an instance of this simple bot on telegram here: [@ExampleOnGitBot](https://t.me/ExampleOnGitBot)

## Features
Easy integration with Telegram Bot API
Docker containerization for simplified deployment
SSL configuration for secure communication with Telegram servers

## Getting Started and Prerequisites:
- Access to a VPS
- Docker and docker-compose installed on your device
- Basic knowledge of command-line tools and environments

## Outside Resources
- Tool to get familiar with VPS: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/vps/
- Tools to get familiar with Docker: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37966552/what-is-the-difference-between-docker-and-docker-compose
- Tools to get famliar with command-line: https://dev.to/how-to-dev/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-command-line-a6g

## Installation 
1. Set Up Enviorment
  -Update your VPS package list: sudo apt-get update
  -Install Docker on your VPS if it's not already installed. 
  -Install docker-compose: sudo apt-get install docker-compose

2. Set Up Variables
  - Export the necessary environment variables used by the Telegram bot. Replace <Your_IP_Address> and <Your_Telegram_Bot_Token> with your actual IP address and Telegram bot token.
  - This should look like this:
      export IP_ADDRESS=<Your_IP_Address>
      export TG_BOT_TOKEN=<Your_Telegram_Bot_Token>
      
3. Create the Bot
  - Clone the repository to your VPS.
  -Navigate to the cloned project directory.
  -Start the deployment process with Docker:

4. Set Up SSL Configurations
  -As part of the Dockerfile setup, SSL files are generated to establish a secure connection with the Telegram servers.
  -These SSL certificates are crucial for setting up the webhook to ensure encrypted communication.

5. You Should Verify Installation
  - You should see your bot container running.
  - If there are any issues, use docker logs <container_id> to troubleshoot. ''

6. Set Up the Webhook
  -With SSL files created and configured, your bot is ready to communicate securely with Telegram's servers.
  -Ensure the webhook is properly set to notify your bot of incoming messages.

7. Congratulations!!!
   - To run the Telegram bot container, make sure you have already installed docker and docker-compose on your device. There you go, now you should have a fully functional Telegram bot running in a docker container.

## Usage
