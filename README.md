# telegrambot
In this repository, I provided a dockerized telegram bot in python. Using this repo you can easily setup a telegram bot to provide a service to people all around the world.
## Usage
First run telegram-bot-setup.sh file to setup the webhook on telegram servers to get messages from the bot as soon as they are sent. In addition Dockerfile is also modified to have the http api token for the telegram bot in it. Then, to run the telegram bot container, just execute the following command `sudo docker-compose up -d`.
